* Description
This layer aims at providing support for Redis integration [[https://github.com/emacs-pe/redis.el][redis]].

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =redis= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

This layer requires [[https://redis.io/][redis]], visit their page for instructions how to install it.

** Working with this layer
After you installed this layer, you could open a scratch, buffer set =redis-mode=
launch redis client process ~SPC m '~, type some redis commands and send the
buffer to the to the redis terminal and see the results.

Alternatively you could write redis commands inside a source block in =org-mode=
as follows.

#+begin_src redis db: 127.0.0.1:6379
SET editor:name "spacemacs"
GET editor:name
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: OK
: spacemacs

|-------------+------------------------------|
| ~SPC m '~   | Launch redis client process  |
| ~SPC m c~   | Send =current-line= to redis |
| ~SPC m b~   | Send =buffer= to redis       |
| ~SPC m r~   | Send =region= to redis       |
